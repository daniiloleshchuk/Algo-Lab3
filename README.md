##### `cd ` into repo directory and run `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` to lauch the code
#### Short algorythm description:
Firstly we loop throungt all devices, and check if current device is not client. If it is - we continue looping throught them, if it is not - we find latencies for every client and take maximum. Then continue looping. After we have found all maximum latencies, we take minimum value. <br> So that, we have minimum latency for the worst case of client location.
